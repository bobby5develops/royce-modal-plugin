# [ javascript-modal-plugin ]


javascript-modal-plugin is a professional front-end modal object, that is feature packed and ready to integrate in any front-end environment. 

## Flexibility is the only requirement. This modal plugin should:
   
   Launch different modals based upon option sets
   Allow users to define custom transitions
   Be responsive
   Have max/min width points
   Anchor to the top of the page if too tall
   Be centered otherwise
   Accept a HTML string, domNode, or ajax data for content. 
   Have no dependencies


   Design: 
   
   Use data-attributes to pass classes and behavior to different modal objects. Currently the simplified version of the modal object fetches the id named content and loads data via type.
